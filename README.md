# parsek

[![Build and Tests](https://github.com/kkarnauk/parsek/actions/workflows/build_test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/kkarnauk/parsek/actions/workflows/build_test.yml)

Parser combinators for Kotlin. It's **under development** right now.

## Inspiration
The project is inspired by an interesting library [better-parse](https://github.com/h0tk3y/better-parse) for combinators. I really liked that and I'll try to create a better parser :)
